FINISHED:

REMOVING POKEMON FROM PARTY AFTER FAINTING
- function change: battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_tryfaintmon(void) -> if (GetBattlerSide(gActiveBattler) == B_SIDE_PLAYER) -> replaced friendship function call with ZeroMonData.

DOUBLED AUDIO SAMPLING RATE - REDUCES NOISE
- I just followed the wiki guide on this. values are now 26758Hz/0x1C0 with buffer changes to 3136/C40.

WIP:

FORCE POKEMON NAME TO BE NAME OF ROUTE CAUGHT ON.
- Will need to replace all calls of DoNamingScreen:
    - battle_scripts_command.c (line 10412, don't call gBattleScriptingCommand "Cmd_trygivecaughtmonnick")
