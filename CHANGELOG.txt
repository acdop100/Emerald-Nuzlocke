FINISHED:

REMOVING POKEMON FROM PARTY AFTER FAINTING
- function change: battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_tryfaintmon(void) -> if (GetBattlerSide(gActiveBattler) == B_SIDE_PLAYER) -> replaced friendship function call with ZeroMonData (line 2991).

DOUBLED AUDIO SAMPLING RATE - REDUCES NOISE
- I just followed the wiki guide on this. values are now 26758Hz/0x1C0 with buffer changes to 3136/C40.

DELETE SAVE ON WHITEOUT
- After a whiteout, the game immediately restarts. 
- Code changed: overworld.c -> DoWhiteOut 
    - Added ClearSaveData() and NewGameInitData() calls.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

WIP:

WORKING BUT NEEDS CLEANUP/CODE CHECKS:

FORCE POKEMON NAME TO BE NAME OF ROUTE CAUGHT ON.
- Will need to replace all calls of DoNamingScreen:
    - battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_trygivecaughtmonnick (line 10408, don't allow nickname screen)


NOT WORKING/IN PROGRESS:

ONLY ALLOW PLAYER TO CATCH FIRST POKEMON ENCOUNTERED PER ROUTE
- Starter pokemon counts as being caught on route 101, need to make sure player can catch another there.
- How to handle?
    - Change code in battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_handleballthrow
        - Function to check on catch if this is first pokemon encountered. If not, release it.
        - Code needs to change in both places where pokemon is caught. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL RULES TO POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT:

CHOICE OF AUTO-RENAME OR NOT

STARTER POKEMON CHOSEN BASED OFF OF TRAINER ID

DON'T SPAWN DUPLICATE POKEMON THE PLAYER HAS ALREADY CAUGHT FOR A FIRST ENCOUNTER ON A ROUTE
