FINISHED:

REMOVING POKEMON FROM PARTY AFTER FAINTING
- function change: battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_tryfaintmon(void) -> if (GetBattlerSide(gActiveBattler) == B_SIDE_PLAYER) -> replaced friendship function call with ZeroMonData (line 2991).

DOUBLED AUDIO SAMPLING RATE - REDUCES NOISE
- I just followed the wiki guide on this. values are now 26758Hz/0x1C0 with buffer changes to 3136/C40.

WIP:

WORKING BUT NEEDS CLEANUP/CODE CHECKS:

FORCE POKEMON NAME TO BE NAME OF ROUTE CAUGHT ON.
- Will need to replace all calls of DoNamingScreen:
    - battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_trygivecaughtmonnick (line 10408, don't allow nickname screen)


NOT WORKING/IN PROGRESS:

DON'T ALLOW PLAYER TO CATCH MORE THAN ONE POKEMON PER ROUTE
- Starter pokemon counts as being caught on route 101, need to make sure player can catch another there.
- How to handle?
    - Change code in battle_scripts_command.c -> Cmd_handleballthrow (line 10059)
        - Function to check on catch if pokemon was caught on that route already. If so, release it.
        - Created sub-function ExtraCatchCheck below Cmd_handleballthrow (line 10207).
        - Code needs to change in both places where pokemon is caught.
